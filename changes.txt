All changes are in the file mainRoute.js

const atomFilePaths = [
  path.join(__dirname, "../atomfile/atom.xml"),
  path.join(__dirname, "../atomfile/atom2.sec"),
  path.join(__dirname, "../atomfile/atom3.sec")
];
created an array called atomFilePaths, which contains the file paths to three Atom files â€“ one our and from other groups

changed variable name here because we use 3 paths now
